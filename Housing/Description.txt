By analyzing a comprehensive dataset that included property characteristics, historical sales data, and economic indicators, we aimed to uncover the underlying factors influencing housing prices and market activity. Utilizing predictive modeling and data visualization techniques, we identified key trends and patterns that drive housing market behavior. The project's findings offer a detailed understanding of the market, assisting real estate professionals, investors, and policymakers in making informed decisions. This analysis highlights the significance of data-driven approaches in real estate, showcasing our ability to leverage big data for strategic insights and predictive foresight in the housing sector.
