In the fall of 2014, the administration of a large private university requested that the Office of Enrollment Management and the Office of Institutional Research work together to identify prospective students who would most likely enroll as new freshmen in the Fall 2015 semester. Historically, inquiries numbered about 90,000+ students, and the university enrolled from 2400 to 2800 new freshmen each Fall semester. It was decided that inquiries for Fall 2014 would be used to build the model to help shape the Fall 2015 freshman class. The data set INQ2015 was built over a period of a several months in consultation with Enrollment Management.We carefully willexplore all variables and build a predictive model for better enrollment management and we'll apply regression and decision tree models to analyze the data.
